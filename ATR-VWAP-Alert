//These signals mostly consist of crossovers between a 13 VWMA and a 62 VWMA. I've found these two moving averages to be quite special in their ability to
//recognize a quick trend using volume data. The VWAP is used in the alert system as well, to give some perspective on which direction we are looking to take. We
//are also using ATR. We only take trades when the ATR is on the move, meaning we have a chance to catch a volatile move! Finally, we use RSI to help weed out bad
//trades. We only take 'longs' with bullish readings from RSI, and we only take 'shorts' with bearish readings from RSI. These alerts are fantastic for catching quick intraday
//trades in either direction. I recommend using a small 'take profit' target rather than using an exit indicator. These trades can move 20-30 pips and reverse just quickly. Good luck!

//How To Use:
//When the alert system is added to the chart, you will notice up/down symbols appear at various locations. For bullish alerts, right click an 'Up' symbol and choose 'Add Alert on VWap & ATR..'
//There are two condition options. Long and short, amd below that 'Buy-Signal/Sell-Signal'. Choose 'long' and 'Buy-Signal'. At options, choose 'Once Per Bar Close'. Design your alert, and you're good to go.
//For bearish signals, find a 'down' signal on the chart. Right click and follow the same process, except choosing 'short/Sell-Signal' conditions.
